## Data for Science Concierge article

Here, we put all `R` code to create figure in the article which can be
seen on [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01070) or
full tex file [here](https://github.com/titipata/science_concierge_manuscript).
The data for each plot is in `data` folder. Also, you can see skeleton
code for experiment in `experiments` folder.

We also include human curated topic list from Society for Neuroscience conference
year 2015 in [human_topic.md](human_topic.md). You can check the actual topic
space based on what we described in manuscript.
